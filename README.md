## Project Description

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to identify various medicinal plants and provide users with relevant information. Below are the key components of the project:

- **CNN Model Training**: We have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of medicinal plants.

- **Flask API**: To deploy the trained model and make predictions accessible, we have built a Flask API. This API serves as the interface for users to interact with the model.

- **Plant Classes**: The model can successfully identify images belonging to six different classes of medicinal plants. These classes are:
  - Arjuna
  - Bramhi
  - Curry
  - Mint
  - Neem
  - Rubble

- **Prediction and Information Retrieval**: Upon successful prediction, users receive information about the identified medicinal plant. This information includes various attributes such as medicinal properties, usage, and precautions.

- **Chatbot Integration**: Additionally, we have integrated a chatbot feature to allow users to ask questions related to the identified plant. The chatbot provides informative responses based on the user's queries.
